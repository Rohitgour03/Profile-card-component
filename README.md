### What I learned

In this project i learned about -

- Adding multiple background images and how to position them
- How to position something using ```position: absolute;``` property
- How to something in the center

### Continued development

I found myself struggling with position while creating this project and I am going to improve on that.

### Useful resources

- [adding Multiple backgroound images](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This helped me for adding multiple background images. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Center anything with css](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand on how to center anything. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
